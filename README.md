Code to accompany the paper "Rational points on X0+(125)" by Vishal Arul and Steffen MÃ¼ller

- The file qc_x0125p.m computes the rational points on X0+(125) using quadratic Chabauty. It requires the QCMod package, available at https://github.com/steffenmueller/QCMod.
- The file x0Nplus_composite.m computes the rational points on X0+(N) for 
  - N = 42, 46, 52, 62, 68, 69, 72, 80, 87, 98 (genus 2, rank 0)
  - N = 57, 74, 77, 111, 121, 143 (genus 2, rank 1)
  - N = 60 (genus 3, has genus 2 rank 0 quotient)
  - N = 100, 96 (genus 3, has elliptic rank 0 quotient)
  - N = 84, 90, 117 (genus 4, has elliptic rank 0 quotient)
  - N = 117 (genus 4, has genus 2 rank 0 quotient)
  - N = 144 (genus 5, has elliptic rank 0 quotient)
  - N = 112 (genus 5, has genus 2 rank 0 quotient)
